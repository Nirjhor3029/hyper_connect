<p>The cash injection will allow the company to&nbsp;maintain and consolidate the position it holds in the international education sector, it said.</p>
<p>“This latest round of funding is a strong vote of confidence from our investors and a testament to Adventus’ growth trajectory and potential,” Victor Rajeevan, Adventus.io CEO &amp; co-founder, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Despite launching in the midst of a pandemic, we’ve expanded our team across 15+ countries, and witnessed remarkable year-on-year growth, and this year is no different.</p>
<p>“The funds will be used to accelerate our technology capabilities (including investments in automation and AI) and deepen our relationship with our partner institutions and recruiters, to ensure we continue to place high-quality students in sought after institutions,” he added.</p>

<p>“We have achieved our global enrolment targets for Q1 and continue to grow our revenue while managing our costs effectively, and we have doubled student enrollments in Q1’23 vs Q1’22.

<p>Adventus.io currently works with&nbsp;over 1,600 education institutions and 8,000 recruiter partners globally. It is on track to&nbsp;process 60,000 students this year.</p>
